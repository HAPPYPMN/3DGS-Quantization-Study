# ðŸ“¦ 3DGS-Quantization-Study

A research-oriented implementation and evaluation toolkit for quantization and compression strategies in **3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)** pipelines.

This repository supports analyzing the impact of quantization on SH color representation, scale and rotation, and implements per-Gaussian importance evaluation strategies for lossy compression.
